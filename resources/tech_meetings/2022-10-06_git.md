### Download
- https://git-scm.com/downloads
- install using the downloaded install file
- to check installation is correct, right click anywhere on your computer and you should see "Git Bash Here"
- selecting this option will open the git terminal, from where you will be able to use git commands
- git commands can also be used in any other terminal as long as git is install on the computer
- examples include: powershell, mac terminal, vs-code terminal, linux terminal

### Why git?
- tracking changes
- incremental tracking
- ability to backtrack
- track changes across different contributors
- get latest repository update
- used by all software dev teams using agile/DevOps

### Git vs GitHub
- git is a version control tool
- github is a remote service that hosts codebases
- lots of other remote services similar to github: bitbucket, gitlab etc

### Navigate github repository
- file structure
	- all code inside ```/src/```
	- each subdirecotyr in ```/src/``` has a different function of the workflow
- summary of sub-functions
	- ```/src/aws``` contains the aws code for deployment to aws
	- ```/src/fmrib``` contains the modelling code
	- ```/src/ml_lifecycle``` contains the code for ML models
	- ```/src/visualizations``` contains the code for interactive visualizations
- ```run_UKB_cTI.sh``` file summarizes all the files run in our current workflow

### Clone github repository onto your own computer
```
git clone https://github.com/zhaohanxiong/OxfordCVM.git
```

### Check status of current directory
```
git status
```

### Add/remove changes
```
git add
git rm
```

### Commit changes
```
git commit -m "message here"
```

### Push changes to remote repository
```
git push
```

### Pull changes from remote repository to local
```
git pull origin
```

### Branch
```
git branch
git checkout branch_name
git branch -D branch_to_delete
```

### Merge
```
git merge base_branch new_branch
```

- can also be done on github via a pull request

### Readmes on github
- ```README.md``` displays readme file in a nice way (using html)

### Ignoring files so git doesnt track
- we dont want to track files which contain data or sensitive information
- this file located in the base directory
- ```.gitignore``` files

### Github workflows
- located in the Actions tab along the top
- CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous develoyment) is a concept which allows teams to integrate code changes and deploy them to their users in an automated way
- github workflows allow this by triggering a workflow whenever the main branchs are updated
- the workflows contain a series of actions/tests which verify the code is working
- once the tests pass, the workflow will then deploy the applications to the desired location (e.g. aws)

### Git Cheatsheet
- this tutorial covers the fundementals which you can use for your average development
- git offers much more in terms of functionality
- a cheat sheet can be found here: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
