### DevOps
- DevOps (development operations) is a set of tools, practices, mindset, and culture which teams use for collaboration
- Collaboration:
  - The key to DevOps
  - Development teams and operations teams collaborate throughout the entire software development lifecycle
  - Everyone is responsible for the quality of deliverables for the product
  - Teams own the compete full-stack (backend to frontend) responsibilities of the product
  - Teams own a feature/project from conception to delivery
  - Results in higher quality output and enhances level of investment
 - Automation:
  - DevOps aims to automate as much of the software development lifecycle as possible
  - Makes developers more focused on developing new features
  - It is a key of CI/CD pipeline which reduces human errors and improves iteration times
 - Continuous Improvement:
  - A focus on experimentation, minimizing waste, optimizing for speed, cost, and ease of delivery
  - Continuously push updates and releases to bring more customer value
 - Customer-Centric Action:
  - Short feedback loops with customers to ensure products are centered around user needs
  - Rapid collection and response to user feedback through live monitoring and rapid deployment
  - Teams get immediate visibility into how users interact with a software
  - Teams use these insights to develop further improvements
 - Create with End in Mind:
  - Understanding the needs of customers and creating products that solve real problems
  - Teams understand the customer and use it to drive creation and implementation
