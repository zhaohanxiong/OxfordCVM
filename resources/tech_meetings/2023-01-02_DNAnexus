### General Opinion
- UKB RAP provides a cloud environment to access the UKB data and run analysis
- The platform uses a set of built-in tools, namely ```dx```, which you have to use to run tasks or connect to the databases
- These tools seems very unconventional on a surface level and poses a high barrier for entry, especially if someone does not have a programming background
- The method of running analysis (outside of R/Python) is also non-conventional as the linux CLI commands are customized for the platform
- Overall, I would not use this platform myself due to the high barrier for entry, non transferrability of the code, unconventional methods, and high cost
