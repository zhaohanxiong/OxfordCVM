### Last Meeting Recap
- You can collaborate on the same codebase with several team members by using ```branch``` and ```merge```
  1) Create a new branch by branching from ```dev```
  2) Introduce code changes into your new branch
  3) ```push``` your branch to GitHub
  4) Open a pull request
  5) Have the request reviewed, if reviews are positive, then it can be ```merged``` into ```dev```
  6) Everyone can then have access to the new functionalities by pulling the updated ```dev``` branch

### Why Collaboration is Important?
- Team members should be working on the same codebase for:
  - Reproducibility
  - Code quality
  - Efficiency of including new functionalities
  - Sharebility with existing or new members
  - Scalability for large projects or projects that last very long
- Team members all working on their own version of the code will result in:
  - Difficult to reproduce experiments if only one person has all the knowledge with regards to specific components
  - Lower code quality as code is not standarized or checked
  - Code overlap where several different team members spend time on different versions of the same task
  - Difficulty when sharing as code tends to get more and more "customized" for your own use instead of being shared
  - Difficult to retrace mistakes and also keep track of very large projects involving many team members

### How to Add Code Changes 
- Code changes should be added incrementally to avoid large changes over multiple files which are difficult to track when bugs occur:
- It is important to always be concious of the code changes you are making:
  - How it impacts existing code
  - How it affects other team members
  - How it affects users
  - Whether your code changes actually contribute to an improvement in the code base, and doesn't repeat existing code
- For each branch/merge, you should aim to include code changes that contribute a SINGLE new functionality:
  - You have created a function that generates a single plot for one of your results
  - You have created a function that performs some new calculation, such as evaluating your model using a new metric
  - You have added one new processing step into the data pre/post-processing code which results in a better input/output for modelling
- Code changes should be aimed towards improving the existing code base rather than introducing completely new pipelines or workflows
  - It saves a lot of time if you adapt all your development so it aligns with what already exists
  - During development, you should actively aim to accomodate the existing code instead of making your own
  - Incrementally adding to the existing code will reduce bugs occuring
  - Even if there may be a better method, you should still follow the existing logic of the code even if it means the code might not be the most optimal
  - Major changes such as adding new pipelines or creating new logic flows should be performed seperately and should not be contributed as a part of improving the current functionality
 - Different developers have different styles and habits, so it is very important for all team members to actively work together to harmonise each others code
  - When every team member develops in the same framework, collaboration becomes much easier and efficient

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery)
- CT/CD is one of the most important principles in software development and is used by most software companies
- CI/CD automates many parts of the collaboration process which significantly increases productivity and the rate at which new features are released
- CI (continuous integration) involves:
  - Automatically incorporating code changes
  - Checking if code changes made have impacted the existing code
  - Integrating, or adding, the new changes automatically if certain criteria are met
 - CD (continous delivery) invovles:
  - Automatically deploying your code to production
  - Performing checks to ensure your code performs the correct functionality
