### Collaboration
- Collaboration is an important part of a development team
- Processes exist for ensuring consistent and efficient updates to the codebase
- A common method is the "branch and merge" which allows multiple team members to collectively develop code
- By following a strict set of criteria, we can update our codebase in a way to ensure existing functions work and new functions are added to improve our codebase

### Making Edits to the Codebase
- You should set up your branch with the following (after downloading the repository with  ```git clone```)
```
git fetch --all
git pull --all
git checkout dev
git pull origin
```

- To make your own code changes, branch from the ```dev``` branch
```
git branch new_branch
git checkout new_branch
```

- Now you have your own version of code that you can edit without affecting the main code in ```dev```
- You can always switch back to ```dev``` when you need the full working version of the code
```
git checkout dev
```

- To switch back to your own development
```
git checkout new_branch
```

- Once you have made your updates to the code, you can ```add```, ```commit```, ```push```
```
git add name_of_files_changes.m
git commit -m "my commit message here"
git push
```

- You may be prompted with a message on ```push``` if your branch is not on the remote repository on github
- The terminal will give you a new command which you can directly copy, paste, and run in your terminal
- This one-time command will be the following below, which you only need to do once during the first ever  ```push``` of your branch
```
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch
```
