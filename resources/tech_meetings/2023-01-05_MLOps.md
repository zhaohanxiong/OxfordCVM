### MLOps
- Extension of DevOps to include machine learning and data science
- Current MLOps revolve around containerization for scalability, Dockerized open-source ML stacks, Kubernetes for deployment
- Design:
    - Requirements engineering
    - ML use-cases prioritization
    - Data availability
- Model Development:
    - Data engineering
    - Model engineering
    - Model testing and validation
- Operations:
    - Model deployment
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - Monitoring & triggering

### Machine Learning Considerations
- Value proposition: identifiy the objectives and end-goals
- Data sources: Hadoop clusters, REST APIs, web scraping, data marts
- Prediction tasks: model type
- Feature engineering
- Offline evaluation
- Decisions: defining the decisions making to replace humans
- Prediction
- Collection more data
- Building models
- Evaluation and monitoring

### End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow
- Data engineering:
    - Data ingestion (spark, HDFS, CSV, data generation, data enrichment)
    - Data exploration (explorative analysis, extracting meta-data, error detection)
    - Data cleaning (handling missing values, re-formating, transforming)
    - Data labeling
    - Data splitting (train, validation, test)
- ML model engineering:
    - ML model training (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, training)
    - Model evaluation (validation, meeting objectives)
    - Model testing (independent testing)
    - Model packaging (exporting model into a specific format for a business application)
        - ```.pb``` in Tensorflow
        - ```.pt``` in PyTorch
        - ```MLeap``` in SparkML
        - ```.h5``` in Keras
        - ```.mlmodel``` for iOS (objective-C/Swift)
- Model deployment:
    - Model serving (addressing the ML model artifact in a production environment)
    - Performance monitoring (tracking, using these metrics as triggers for re-training)
    - Performance logging (inference request results in log-record)

### Online Learning
- Embed machine learning model into a production system
- The model receives a data stream and gets re-trains on-the-fly
- Works well with the lambda architecture (large data handling and processing)
- Usually runs on a service such as kunernettes cluster
- Must monitor the quality of data to drive the online-learning

### Model Serving Patterns
- Model-as-Service:
    - Wrap model in a web service with a REST API or gRPC service
    - Called as a web app for input/prediction
- Model-as-Dependency:
    - Package ML model as a dependency within a software application
- Precompute-Serving:
    - Pre-compute predictions for incoming batch of data when we query a database, and store in a database
    - Use these as further input for a model serving

### Deployment Strategies
- Docker containers, managed through kubernettes
- Serverless functions (Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning, IBM Watson, AWS Lambda)
- Containerization services (AWS Lambda, Google App Engine)

### Automation
- Machine learning pipelines contain more automation with increased maturity
- Manual process:
    - Manual execution at every stage of the pipeline (preparation, validation, training, testing)
    - Often use Jupyter notebooks
- ML pipeline automation:
    - Trigger a process of re-training when new data is available
    - Automate data and model validation steps
- CI/CD pipelines:
    - Automate all the above
    - Also automate build, test, deploy for the data, model, and model training components
    - Continuous integration of source code and code testing
    - Continuous delivery of pipelines to the target environment (package and deploy executables)
    - Automated triggering (automatically executed pipeline in production, train model stored in a model registry)
    - Continuous delivery of models (serving models for prediction)
    - Monitoring (model performance, logging)
- Components:
    - Source control (versioning, experiment tracking)
    - Test/build services
    - Deployment services
    - Model services
    - Feature store
    - ML meta data store
    - ML pipeline orchestrator
