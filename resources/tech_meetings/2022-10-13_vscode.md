### VS-Code
- Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Most widely used IDE (integrated development environment) used in industry
	- wide range of tools integrated in vs-code
	- constant support/updating by developers
- Coding interface:
	- File structure visibility, even when working on remote repositories
		- allows easily navigationg through all files
		- allows creation/deletion of files
	- Terminal (right click > open integrated terminal)
		- you can open multiple terminals at different file locations for different tasks
	- Very nice coding interface
		- allows viewing of multiple different scripts of code
		- automatic error detecting
		- automatic code colouring
		- easy to navigate multiple files at once, as well as long scripts
		- viewing multiple scripts, or different parts of the same script at the same time
	- integrated with git
		- tracks file changes as you go from your last commit
		- git tool on the left hand side bar allows manual git actions (add, remove, stage, commit)
		- interactively resolving conflicts when pulling new code

- Dependencies:
	- Remote SSH
	- Python (PyLance reader)
	- R (R code reader)
	- Matlab (Matlab code reader)
	- Excel viewer (to view csv files)
	- Jupyter note book

- SSH using VS-code:
	- in to remote servers/clusters (i.e. FMRIB cluster)
	- located with monitor icon on left side bar
	- click ```+``` sign
	- type in ```SSH my.remote.server@host.ac.uk```
	- enter your ```login password``` in the VS-code prompt
	- you are now connected to your remote server
		- interactive acccess to all files/directories
		- ability to view all code/scripts
		- access to the terminal for running linux commands

- Integrated terminal:
	- allows windows PowerShell commands
	- Linux Shell commands
	- as well as other terminal-accessed tools such as git/docker/aws CLI

- Basic Linux Shell Commands:
	- ```cd /my/path``` (navigate directories)
	- ```cd ..``` (navigate to outside the current directory)
	- ```pwd``` (get current working directory)
	- ```ls``` (list all files/folders in current directory)
	- ```mkdir /name_of_new_folder``` (create directory)
	- ```rm /filename``` (remove single files)
	- ```rm -r /file/directory``` (remove entire directories)
	- ```chmod``` (changing permissions of access)

- Integrated development environment:
	- allows files of multiple languages in one place for viewing/editing
	- can run python/R/matlab in one place
	- allows the setting up of virtual environments
