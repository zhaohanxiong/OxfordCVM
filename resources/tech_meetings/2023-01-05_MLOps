### MLOps
- Extension of DevOps to include machine learning and data science
- Current MLOps revolve around containerization for scalability, Dockerized open-source ML stacks, Kubernetes for deployment

### Machine Learning Considerations
- Value proposition: identifiy the objectives and end-goals
- Data sources: Hadoop clusters, REST APIs, web scraping, data marts
- Prediction tasks: model type
- Feature engineering
- Offline evaluation
- Decisions: defining the decisions making to replace humans
- Prediction
- Collection more data
- Building models
- Evaluation and monitoring

### End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow
- Data engineering:
    - Data ingestion (spark, HDFS, CSV, data generation, data enrichment)
    - Data exploration (explorative analysis, extracting meta-data, error detection)
    - Data cleaning (handling missing values, re-formating, transforming)
    - Data labeling
    - Data splitting (train, validation, test)
- ML model engineering:
    - ML model training (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, training)
    - Model evaluation (validation, meeting objectives)
    - Model testing (independent testing)
    - Model packaging (exporting model into a specific format for a business application)
- Model deployment:
    - Model serving (addressing the ML model artifact in a production environment)
    - Performance monitoring (tracking, using these metrics as triggers for re-training)
    - Performance logging (inference request results in log-record)
